myFlix-client

Intro:

MyFlix is a client side app used to view a list of movies. Users will be able to login and view information about movies, directors, genres and more. The user will also be able to add and remove movies from their favorites list, update their profile information and unregister.

The front end is built using React and accesses the MyFlix API.
My Role:

Combined my previously created Movies API with a newly designed Frontend structure.
Created a website using React and Bootstrap where users can browse, search and save their favorite movies.
